I am 2nd year PhD student in economics at [RED - Rome Economics Doctorate](https://www.redphd.it/), a joint program between [EIEF](https://www.eief.it/eief/) and [LUISS](https://www.luiss.edu/). My main research interest is labor economics, and my supervisor is [Matteo Paradisi](https://www.matteoparadisi.com/).
