Welcome to my page! 

I am 2nd year PhD student in economics at [RED - Rome Economics Doctorate](https://www.redphd.it/), a joint program between [EIEF](https://www.eief.it/eief/) and [LUISS](https://www.luiss.edu/). My main research interest is labor economics, and my supervisor is [Matteo Paradisi](https://www.matteoparadisi.com/). 

Previously, I worked for one year at [CLEAN](https://clean.unibocconi.eu/), a research unit in Bocconi University that focuses on Crime Economics. I obtained both my MSc and BSc in Economics at the [Erasmus School of Economics](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese).
