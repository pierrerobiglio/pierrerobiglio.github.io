Welcome to my page!

I am a MSc. student enrolled in the international program in [Physics of Complex Systems](http://www.pcs.polito.it). I am moving my first steps into graduate studies and reasearch. 

My interest relies in the study of Complex Systems using tools from Network Science and Statistical Physics with a particular focus on Higher-Order systems.

I am currently working on my MSc thesis under the supervision of [Alain Barrat](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~barrat/english.html) and [Mathieu GÃ©nois](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/spip.php?page=personne&id_personne=143&lang=en) at [CPT](https://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/?lang=en) in Marseille. The thesis deals with the the study of attractiveness and higher-order structures in face-to-face interactions in human gatherings. I am also working in the [NPL](https://nplresearch.github.io) group at [Centai](https://centai.eu/home) in Torino on the inference of higher-order structures from Kuramoto dynamics.
