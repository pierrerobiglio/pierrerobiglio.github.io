Welcome to my page!

I am a 2nd year PhD Student in Economics at the [Rome Economics Doctorate](https://www.redphd.it/), a joint program between [EIEF](https://www.eief.it/eief/index.php/it/), [LUISS](https://www.luiss.edu/) and [Tor Vergata](https://web.uniroma2.it/).

My primary research interest is Labor Economics, and [Matteo Paradisi](https://www.matteoparadisi.com/) is my supervisor.

Before joining the RED, I was a research assistant at [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.it/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_it/albero+di+navigazione/home/entrare+in+bocconi/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwjryjBhD0ARIsAMLvnF_E6_M83rgPlqXp3zOBdwnjo3FxoxCphbxk0H7Mj2tVMqfHGbHOaeYaAjADEALw_wcB). I obtained both my BSc and MSc in Economics from [ESE](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese).
