I am attending the [Spring College on the Physics of Complex Systems](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10059/) at ICTP in Trieste, Italy. There I will also be presenting [a poster](https://thomasrobiglio.github.io/assets/pdf/draft_interacting_simplagion_poster.pdf) on our work "Simplicially driven simple contagion".
