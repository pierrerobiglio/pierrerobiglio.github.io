**Hello there!**

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a PhD student in Complex Systems and Network Science at [IT:U, Interdisciplinary Transformation University - Austria](https://it-u.at/en/).
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My interest relies in the study of complex systems using tools from network science and statistical physics with a particular focus on [inferential methods](https://skewed.de/lab/research.html) and higher-order systems.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I work under the supervision of [Tiago P. Peixoto](https://skewed.de/lab/contact.html) on the formulation of generative models for temporal networks and the application of network inference methods to the analysis of [internal migrations in Austria](https://moma.science).
</p>

::: {.callout-tip title="Get in touch!"}
Feel free to reach out if you have any *questions/comments/ideas*, or just want to say hello!
