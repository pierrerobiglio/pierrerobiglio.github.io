**Hello there!**

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a PhD student in Economics at [Rome Economics Doctorate (RED)](https://www.redphd.it/), a program jointly run by [EIEF](https://www.eief.it/eief/), [LUISS](https://www.luiss.it/) and [Tor Vergata](https://web.uniroma2.it/).
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My research interests are Labor Economics and Industrial Organizations. My JMP, co-authored with with [Edoardo Scalcione](https://sites.google.com/view/edoardo-scalcione/bio/), is at the intersection of these two fields; we use administrative data to study the labor implications of a collusive scheme in the Portuguese labor market.  
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My supervisors are [Matteo Paradisi](https://www.matteoparadisi.com/) and [Emilio Calvano](https://emiliocalvano.wixsite.com/emiliocalvano). 
</p>

Feel free to reach out if you have any *questions/comments/ideas*, or just want to say hello!
